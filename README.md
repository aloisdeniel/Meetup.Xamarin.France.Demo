# Meetup.Xamarin.France

![](Documentation/Preview.gif)

This *Xamarin.iOS* demo app will be used as the background for various conferences. 

### Note

This application has a lot of boilerplate code that should not be used as if in production (*MVVM*, *IoC*, ...). This is only here for educational purpose, so be warned.

It is still a **work in progress**.

## 21/02/2017 - Testing

The first conference was dedicated to mobile app testing.
